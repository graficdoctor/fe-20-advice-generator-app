## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've been learning all week on how to work with API's and JSON-files. This was a nice excercise to put that what I learned into a real thing.

### Useful resources

- [Creating Glow Effects with CSS](https://codersblock.com/blog/creating-glow-effects-with-css/) - I had a look here on how to write the glowing shadow for the button. The diagram on the website really helped me to adapt my code.
- [Responsive images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images) - This is the first time I used the `<picture>`-element. While I actually had the intention of using `srcset` I noticed upon reading `picture` would be better.
